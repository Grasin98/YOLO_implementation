# YOLO_implementation

First of all we need to convert the .protos file to .py files,
here I have already converted it.

Also for this would would be needing tensorflow 1.4.0 version or newer.

Then open up the MAIN folder and execute the code there.
This would not be possible without the tensorflow/model session at github, and Sentdex(YouTube channel)
